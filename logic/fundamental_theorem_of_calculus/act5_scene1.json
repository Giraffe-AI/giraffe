    "scene-narration": "So, there you have it. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the cornerstone of calculus, beautifully ties together the concepts of differentiation and integration. It's a powerful tool that allows us to solve complex problems with relative ease. Remember, the beauty of mathematics lies not just in its complexity, but also in its simplicity and elegance. Until next time, happy calculating!"
