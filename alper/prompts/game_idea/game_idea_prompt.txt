I want you to come up with a simple 2D game idea. Ideally, this idea should be inspired by some everyday task. Make sure the implementation of this game is not too complicated.

After coming up with the idea, fill out these game parameters:
 - game genre (action, adventure, racing, shooter, sports, etc.) but NO PUZZLES
 - movement type (platformer, top-down, side-scrolling, vertical-scrolling, single-screen multi-level,etc.)
 - game mechanics (jumping, shooting, jumping, shooting, running, driving, swimming, flying etc.)
 - game dynamics (gravity, friction, collision detection, etc.)
 - object properties (movable, immovable, destructible, collectible, harmful)
 - score system (points for enemies, points for items, time-based score, etc.)
 - game rules (winning conditions, losing conditions, game ending conditions etc.) 
 - visual aesthetics (color palette, sprite size and design, background, animation, etc.)
 - randomizable elements (colors, positions, etc.)

Finally, give me an overall idea of how the game works.
