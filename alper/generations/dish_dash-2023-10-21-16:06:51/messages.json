The goal is to clean as many dishes as possible within a given time frame while avoiding obstacles like slippery soap suds and broken dishes.\n\nGame Parameters:\n\n- Game Genre: Action\n- Movement Type: Single-screen multi-level\n- Game Mechanics: Running, grabbing, throwing\n- Game Dynamics: Collision detection, time pressure\n- Object Properties: Movable (dishes, soap suds), immovable (sink, dish rack), harmful (broken dishes)\n- Score System: Points for each dish cleaned, bonus points for speed and efficiency, points deducted for broken dishes\n- Game Rules: The game ends when the time runs out. The player wins if they reach a certain score within the given time. The player loses if they break too many dishes or fail to reach the score target.\n- Visual Aesthetics: Bright and colorful palette, medium-sized sprites, a detailed kitchen background, smooth animations for the character and moving objects\n- Randomizable Elements: Position of dishes, frequency of soap suds, occurrence of broken dishes\n\nOverall Game Idea:\n\n\"Dish Dash\" starts with the player character in front of a sink filled with dirty dishes. The player must quickly grab dishes, clean them, and place them in the dish rack. Soap suds will randomly appear and move across the screen, causing the player to slip and slow down if they collide. Occasionally, a broken dish will appear in the sink, and the player must avoid grabbing it or lose points. The game becomes more challenging as it progresses, with dishes appearing more frequently and soap suds moving faster. The player must strategize and prioritize their actions to clean as many dishes as possible while avoiding obstacles. The game ends when the time runs out, and the player's score is calculated based on the number of dishes cleaned, the speed of cleaning, and the number of broken dishes grabbed.1.
