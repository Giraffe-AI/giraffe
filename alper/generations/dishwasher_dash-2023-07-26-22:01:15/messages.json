The objective is to clean all dishes within a time limit. Dishes come in from the right side of the screen on a conveyor belt. The player must grab dishes, wash them at the sink (a stationary location), and put them on the drying rack.\n\nIf the player does not grab a dish in time, it falls and breaks, causing a penalty to the score. Some dishes might require multiple wash actions to be fully cleaned. The speed of the conveyor belt and the number of dishes increase with each level. The game ends when the player has cleared all the levels or when they break too many dishes, leading to a game over.\n\nThis simple yet engaging concept, inspired by the everyday task of washing dishes, provides a balance of action and strategy, with the necessity to time actions right, manage priorities, and react to changing game dynamics.1. Write the code for this game using pygame==2.5.0. \n2. Don't avoid complexity. \n3. Write the whole code in one chunk at every code generation stage.\n4. Use the following imports:\nimport pygame \nimport random\nimport math\n5. Always write python code between ```python ```.\n6. At the end of each code generation stage, always write down a list of your completed tasks and your remaining TODOs\nYou may begin.\n"}]
