"Imagine you have a black box that takes in some parameters and automatically generates a 2D game. What parameters would you require to generate all Atari games?


Game parameters:

 - game genre (action, adventure, racing, shooter, sports, etc.)
 - movement type (platformer, top-down, side-scrolling, vertical-scrolling, single-screen multi-level,etc.)
 - game mechanics (jumping, shooting, jumping, shooting, running, driving, swimming, flying etc.)
 - game dynamics (gravity, friction, collision detection, etc.)
 - object properties (movable, immovable, destructible, collectible, harmful)
 - score system (points for enemies, points for items, time-based score, etc.)
 - game rules (winning conditions, losing conditions, game ending conditions etc.) 
 - visual aesthetics (color palette, sprite size and design, background, animation, etc.)
 - randomizable elements (colors, positions, etc.)


- To refine games
    - Do the proportions in this game look right to you?
    - Do the dynamics in this game look right to you?
