Using the game idea above, come up with the following type of json that includes 
1. the name of the game in snake case
2. jsonification of the elements described above 
3. A section called "image assets". This section is really important as the game generator will be grabbing these assets. 
To add an image asset, 
    a. add an element to the image_assets section with a snake case name
    b. the value has to be the google images search query you would have to perform to obtain this image.
        i. Always add "png" at the end of the prompt for better results.
        ii. Don't write the query in snake case

{
    "name": [game_name],
    "genre": [game_genre],
    ...
    "image_assets"
    {
        [asset_1_name]:[google images search you would perform to find asset 1]
        [asset_2_name]:[google image search you would perform to find asset 1]
        ...
    }
}

Respond to this message in JSON. Do not say anything else.
