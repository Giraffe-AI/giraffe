Overall Game Idea:

"Dish Dash" is set in a busy restaurant kitchen. The player controls a dishwasher character who needs to clean as many dishes as possible. Dishes come in from the right side of the screen and the player needs to catch them, clean them at the sink, and then place them in the dishwasher. Occasionally, soap suds will appear which the player needs to dodge or they will slip and lose time. Sometimes dishes will fall from the overhead rack and the player needs to catch them before they hit the ground and break. The game is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes and strategic planning to achieve high scores.
