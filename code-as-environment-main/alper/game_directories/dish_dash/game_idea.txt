Overall Game Idea:

The player controls a character in a restaurant kitchen, moving left and right to grab dirty dishes, clean them at the sink, and place them on the dish rack. The player must avoid slipping on soap suds and breaking dishes, both of which can slow them down and deduct points. The game becomes more challenging as the pace of incoming dishes increases and more obstacles appear. The player must strategize and prioritize tasks to achieve the highest score within the time limit.
