    "scene-narration": "Welcome to another episode of 3blue1brown. Today, we're going to explore the Pythagorean theorem, a fundamental principle in geometry. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. We often express this as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2."
