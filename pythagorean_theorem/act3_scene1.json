    "scene-narration": "Consider a square with side length a + b. We can divide this square into a smaller square of side length c and four right-angled triangles. The area of the larger square is (a+b)\u00b2, which equals a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. The combined area of the smaller square and the triangles is c\u00b2 + 2ab. Equating these two gives us a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, which is the Pythagorean theorem."
