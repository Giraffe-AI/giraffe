            "scene-narration": "The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry. It states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. We often express this as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2."

It's a fundamental relationship that holds true for any right-angled triangle, regardless of its size or orientation.

We can form a right-angled triangle with these points and the origin, and then use the theorem to calculate this distance. This is just one of the many practical applications of this fundamental theorem."
